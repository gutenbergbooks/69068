<span class="small">HOPE FOR THE MULVANEYS</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally Brown</span> remembered the Mulvaneys.
It was no wonder the child talked of them
at first; but, when she had lived in the country
two months, her mother and brother Alfred
begged her to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Give us a rest," was Alfred's repeated
command.</p>

<p>"Really, Sally," her mother remonstrated
one morning, "what is the use of thinking of
the Mulvaneys all the time? If it did any
good I wouldn't say a word, but you only
make us uncomfortable without helping them
in the least."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>"Well, mamma," was the reply, "you see
I can't help hoping."</p>

<p>"Hoping," mocked Alfred, "hoping for
what, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>"If your name was Chinky Mulvaney
you'd guess quick enough," was Sally's retort.
"I am hoping the Mulvaneys will get
out of the city same as we did."</p>

<p>"Hoping won't get them out," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Maybe it won't and maybe it will," Sally
remarked. "I notice that when you hope for
things hard enough, you're pretty sure to get
them. That is," she added, "if you do some
squirming too. Don't you know, Alfred, you
can help things happen if you try. I've discovered
there's more'n one way of hoping."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown was ready to go out. "Sally,
my child," was her parting advice, "hope all
you wish, but please don't mention the Mulvaneys
to Alfred or me for one week."</p>

<p>"She'd never live," Alfred said, as he
grabbed his cap and followed his mother.</p>

<p>Sally flew to the kitchen. "I can talk to
you about the Mulvaneys, can't I, Mrs.
Turner? Now I am ready to wash the dishes.
Alfred's gone to the post-office, and mamma

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span>
has gone to sew for Mrs. Reuben Smith;
that's why I didn't get out here sooner; I
had to see them off. Mamma says,—what
do you think?—that I mustn't say Mulvaney
to her for a week. I can talk to you,
though, can't I?"</p>

<p>"Indeed you may," laughed Mrs. Isaac
Turner. "I feel as if I had known the Mulvaneys
all my life. Talk about them, of
course you may. Is Mrs. Mulvaney a nice
looking woman?"</p>

<p>"Dear me, no," laughed Sally, playing with
the soapsuds in the dishpan. "She's about
as unpretty as any one you ever saw. She's
cross as a bear, too, but who wouldn't be?
Just 'magine, Mrs. Turner, if you lived in a
horrid little pig-pen house, and you had seven
acting children and your Mr. Mulvaney was
dead, and you had to take in washing? I do
wish they could come out in the country. I
wish they could live in this very village.
Why, Mrs. Turner, they are the most discouraging
children you ever saw. There's
Hannah and Chinky and Nora and Dora and
Mike and Johnnie and Stubbins, and they all
look worse'n they act."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Mrs. Turner, "I know them
every one, Sally, just as well as if I had seen
their photographs. Hannah is tall and thin;
Chinky is red-headed and freckled; Mike is
full of mischief; and Johnnie's always getting
into trouble; and Stubbins is a terror. Now
why do you want such a family turned loose
in our pretty village?"</p>

<p>"Don't laugh, Mrs. Turner, because it is
dreadful for children not to have better
things. They live down by the railroad tracks
and the river, in mud and dirt. I think it is
worse for them because they have always
lived there, and they don't know anything
different. They are not so very bad yet, but
you just wait and see what'll happen if they
stay there."</p>

<p>"How is it, Sally, that you like such children?"</p>

<p>"Because," was the instant response, "I
got acquainted with them. I've discovered
that you're pretty sure to like every one if
you only get well enough acquainted. I never
knew how good Mrs. Mulvaney was until
mamma was taken to the hospital, and Mrs.
Mulvaney took me and Alfred in. Of course

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>

she was cross and everything, but I'll never
forget how good she was to us, nor how she
cried for joy,—that's what mamma said,—because
they had a gay Christmas for once
in their lives. She was glad mamma and
Alfred and I could come here to live, too;
and now I'll tell you something, Mrs. Turner.
I'm not the only one that's hoping. This is
exactly what Mrs. Mulvaney said when we
talked it over. 'We'll put for the country,
too, Sally, if we ever get a chance!' So you
see, she wants to come."</p>

<p>Nothing more was said about the Mulvaneys
for a week, which doesn't mean that
Sally forgot them. It happened this way:
Alfred brought a letter from the post-office
that Saturday morning addressed to Mrs.
Elizabeth Brown, and as Mrs. Elizabeth
Brown was away all day, the children passed
their spare time wondering about its contents.
At night their curiosity was satisfied. A
farmer's daughter needed the help of a dressmaker
for two weeks. Better than that she
wrote, "Come as soon as possible, and bring
both your children. They can walk to school
every day with my brother."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>"That lets me out," declared Alfred; "but
you may go, Sally, just the same." To show
how little he cared, Alfred whistled "Yankee
Doodle."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Turner would give you a
vacation," suggested Sally.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't ask him," was the reply.
"When they take a feller to work for his
board in a grocery store after school hours,
and to do chores around the house, he's got
to tend to business or lose his job."</p>

<p>Alfred sometimes put on airs. Sally always
felt humiliated when her brother talked
about working for his board, and how fortunate
it was that one of his mother's children
happened to be a boy. "What if we'd both
been girls?" he used to ask in tones of scorn.
Instead of feeling sorry for Alfred, when she
and her mother were driven to the Randall
farm, Sally envied him because of his importance
at home.</p>

<p>"How do you like it out there?" asked
the boy at recess a few days later.</p>

</div>
<div class="caption">"'HE PUT ON ONE OF HER NEW DRESSES'"</div>

<p>"The only thing I don't like," was the
reply, "is coming to school with Tom Randall.
I am glad he isn't my brother. He's
the worst tease I ever saw. Why Alfred, you
are a perfect angel beside of him. He made
Cornelia Mary cry last night, and she's sixteen."</p>

<p>"Who's Cornelia Mary?"</p>

<p>"She's his sister. He put on one of her
new dresses mamma is making, and said he
was going to wear it out to milk the cows."</p>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>

<p>"Did he do it?" inquired Alfred.</p>

<p>"No, his mother made him take it off.
He's fourteen and he thinks he knows it all."</p>

<p>"The boys all like him, Sally. If girls
weren't so silly they wouldn't have so much
trouble."</p>

<p>"You needn't think that bothers me,"
laughed Sally, "because I want to tell you
about the Randalls. They're the nicest
people ever, all but Tom. They live in a
great big white house with green blinds and
wide verandas. It must be lovely in the
summer. You ought to see their cows and
their horses and their chickens, and when I
say chickens I mean everything with feathers;
pigeons, ducks, and geese, turkeys, and even
guinea hens. Oh, but it's nice. I can't begin
to tell you. Cornelia Randall is the sweetest

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>

girl you ever saw, too. She told me to call
her Cornelia Mary except when I go visiting
her school next summer, then I must say 'Miss
Randall,' to set the country children a good
example."</p>

<p>"Is she going to be a school teacher?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Alfred, and she says she can hardly
wait for summer. She's passed her examination
and got her certificate, and she's going
to teach over in the Hodgkins district. Tom
declares he'll visit her school and make
speeches to the children. It would be just
like him, and she couldn't put him out either,
if she tried. Cornelia Mary says sometimes
she wishes she was an only child."</p>

<p>"Nice and selfish," suggested Alfred.</p>

<p>"You never lived with Tom Randall," observed
Sally. "There he comes now, and
don't you dare tell what I told you."</p>

<p>"Won't I though?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you won't, Alfred. Wait a minute,"
she called, "I want to tell you something.
I'm still hoping about the Mulvaneys;
they would have such a good time in the
country!"</p>

<span class="small">SALLY BROWN'S NEW IDEA</span>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following Saturday Tom Randall
heard some news.</p>

<p>"You can't guess the latest!" he shouted,
as he ran up the stairs three steps at a time,
reaching the door of the sewing-room out of
breath, and beaming with smiles.</p>

<p>"It must be something good," ventured
Sally, forgetting to pull basting threads in her
eagerness to hear more.</p>

<p>Cornelia Mary looked doubtfully at her
brother. "Well, what is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Get your camphor bottle ready. I'm going
to let you down easy, but you had better
be prepared. Corny, your school's gone.
You won't teach in the Hodgkins district
this year, I can tell you right now."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just what I said."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>"Did the schoolhouse burn up?"</p>

<p>"Worse'n that."</p>

<p>"Have they hired another teacher?"</p>

<p>"Worse yet."</p>

<p>"Come, Tom, tell us," besought Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p>"He's fooling!" declared Sally.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I mean what I say," insisted
Tom. "Corny's school has gone, bag and
baggage."</p>

<p>"Well, how could it?" demanded Cornelia
Mary.</p>

<p>Tom shrugged his shoulders. "I don't
know how it could be so cruel," he said,
"but maybe it didn't like to have you for a
teacher. Fact is, it's gone. The Beans and
the Kilpatricks have got work in the sugar
factory, and they moved to town. There
goes your A Class and your B Class and—"</p>

<p>"Well, the Chart Class isn't gone," interrupted
Cornelia Mary, laughing in spite of
herself at Tom's antics. "You can have a
school if there's only one child in the whole
district and little Willie Jessup begins this
summer. Poor little fellow, he'll be lonesome."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>"No, little Willie won't be lonesome,"
mocked Tom, "because little Willie's going
too. I tell you, Corny, your school's gone.
Cheer up, you've got me left. I'll be home
all summer. Never mind the Hodgkins district,
let it go."</p>

<p>"You go away," retorted Cornelia Mary,
struggling with tears, "you're a comfort,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"It was my painful duty, Corny, to tell
you before the neighbours did and this is all
the thanks I get, just 'go away.' What an
ungrateful world it is. Never mind, Corny,
if you ever need a friend, you come back to
your sweet brother. He'll forgive you."</p>

<p>"Will you go away!" repeated Cornelia
Mary.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," was the reply, "I mustn't stay
in a damp place for fear of rheumatism.
Better get up your umbrella, Sally," and
Tom went away whistling.</p>

<p>Cornelia Mary did cry, at least she cried
until Sally Brown appeared to be very much
excited about something.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Mrs. Brown,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>

while Cornelia Mary wiped her eyes and
stared.</p>

<p>"Why—why the Mulvaneys!" exclaimed
Sally. "Why can't they move out here and
go to school?"</p>

<p>"Who are the Mulvaneys?" asked Cornelia
Mary.</p>

<p>"Well, they're the Mulvaneys," Sally insisted,
"and—"</p>

<p>"Can it be," interrupted Mrs. Brown,
"that Sally has never mentioned them to
you?"</p>

<p>"Never," replied Cornelia Mary. "Do
tell me about them."</p>

<p>"You, mamma, you will tell it so much
better than I could."</p>

<p>"It is a dismal story," began Mrs. Brown,
"and one I would gladly have forgotten."</p>

<p>"Why Mamma Brown!"</p>

<p>"Don't misunderstand me, Sally; I shall
never forget Mrs. Mulvaney's kindness, but
as I have said a dozen times, we cannot help
the family and there is no use in continually
dwelling upon their misery."</p>

<p>"Only I can't help hoping," murmured
Sally. "Go on, mamma."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>When the story was finished, Cornelia
Mary turned to Sally with a puzzled look on
her face.</p>

<p>"How do you think we could get that
family into the Hodgkins district?" she
asked. "What would they do? I mean,
where would they live, and what could Mrs.
Mulvaney do to earn their bread and butter,
I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't she take in washing?" demanded
Sally.</p>

<p>Cornelia Mary shook her head. "I'm
afraid not in the country."</p>

<p>"Oh, but she could," Sally declared.
"Mrs. Turner says she could get more
washing to do in the village than five
women could manage, especially when the
summer boarders are there. Mrs. Turner
says too she's even wondered why some one
doesn't start a laundry."</p>

<p>"But that's in the village and wouldn't
help my school any."</p>

<p>"Maybe that's true," agreed Sally, "but
couldn't they live in the country, and couldn't
Chinky and Hannah go after the washings
and take them home? The worst trouble is

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>

finding a place for the Mulvaneys to live.
There isn't a house they could get in the
village."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>Sally smiled. "Oh, Mrs. Turner and I
went house-hunting only last Saturday. We
thought maybe we could find a cheap little
house, but we couldn't on account of the new
sugar factory. Houses are scarce and rents
are high. We found out a few things.
That's the way I do my hoping, mamma."</p>

<p>"Would they come?" inquired Cornelia
Mary, growing interested.</p>

<p>"Come!" echoed Sally, "they'd come
flying!"</p>

<p>"Yes, they would," agreed her mother.
"There's no doubt of it. But how could we
manage, Cornelia Mary? Where could they
get a house, and how could they furnish
it?"</p>

<p>"Of course they would have to bring their
furniture," suggested Cornelia Mary.</p>

<p>"But they haven't anything worth mentioning,
even if they could afford the expense.
I doubt if Mrs. Mulvaney ever had
money enough ahead to buy tickets for the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>

whole family, and their clothes are unthinkable.
No, it is hopeless."</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Mrs. Brown, on account
of my school. If there is a way to get them
here, Sally and I must do it. Father will
help us, I know. Come on, Sally, we'll go
and find him. If what Tom says is true,
and I'm sure it is because I heard something
about it last week, why, there'll be
three houses empty and perhaps we may be
able to get one of them cheap."</p>

<p>"You never can tell until you try," added
Sally.</p>

</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Beans, the Kilpatricks, and the Jessups
might as well have taken their houses
with them so far as the Mulvaneys were
concerned. Mr. Bean's father and mother
were to live in their vacant house. The Kilpatrick
home was rented to an old couple
related to the Beans, while the residence of
the Jessups was to be torn down.</p>

<p>Cornelia Mary and Sally drove slowly
homeward after their first experience in
country house-hunting.</p>

<p>"Now what do you think?" inquired
Cornelia Mary, giving the reins an impatient
jerk.</p>

<p>"I think—" began Sally, "well, I think
we got left."</p>

<p>That remark made the girls laugh. Having
laughed the prospect seemed less dismal.</p>

<div class="caption">"POINTING TO A DILAPIDATED WEATHER-BEATEN STRUCTURE ALMOST<br />
HIDDEN FROM VIEW"</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>"Wasn't it too bad about the Jessup
house?" Cornelia Mary resumed. "It was
so tumbled down the rent couldn't be much
and they might have got along somehow.
Was it a great deal worse than the house
they live in?"</p>

<p>"Worse," echoed Sally, "it was sixty hundred
times better. Why, the Mulvaneys live
in a little bit of a black old shanty—" Sally
stopped suddenly, then exclaimed in excited
tones, "A house! A house! Whoa!"</p>

<p>"A house?" questioned Cornelia Mary,
looking into the sky as if expecting to see
it drop from the clouds.</p>

<p>"Right there!" continued Sally, pointing
to a dilapidated weather-beaten structure almost
hidden from view by overgrown bushes
and old weed stalks.</p>

<p>"Giddap," laughed Cornelia Mary, "trot
along. Why, Sally, you gave me such a
start. I am sure I know now how Columbus
felt when the mariners shouted land."</p>

<p>"But it's a house," insisted Sally, "and
no one is living in it. Whoa, horse! Make
him stop, Cornelia Mary, I want to get out.
Who owns that house and why is it empty?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>"All right, whoa, Bess! Climb out, Sally,
you shall see the house, that is if you can
reach it without tearing your dress. Wait
a minute while I tie the horse to this tree."</p>

<p>"But it's deserted!" Sally exclaimed, "and
the windows are all boarded up; we can't see
much. Who owns it? Let's go for the
key?"</p>

<p>"No one will ever live in that house
again," declared Cornelia Mary. "To begin
with, it's the oldest house in the country and
the man who built it lived in it for a long
time. Then he built a new house and his
hired man lived here. After that a great
many different families rented it; then for
years it was empty. One time a crazy man,
whose folks owned the mill, broke in the
house and said he was going to stay there
until he died. The owner said let him have
his own way as he was harmless, and if the
family would supply his wants he might have
the house rent free."</p>

<p>"And did he live here all alone way back
from the road?" asked Sally, gazing curiously
about the place.</p>

<p>"Yes, and they say he was happier than

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>

he ever was in his life before; he kept
chickens and pigs and had gardens—why,
Sally, there is a regular wild flower garden
here every summer to this day, and the man's
been dead since long before I was born."</p>

<p>"And hasn't anybody lived here since?"
asked Sally.</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Cornelia Mary shrugged her shoulders.
"Oh, folks are queer about some things,
Sally. I wouldn't stay all night in this house
for anything, myself, not for anything."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, don't you see, the old fellow was
crazy, and sometimes he used to sing and
howl all night long."</p>

<p>"But, Cornelia Mary, he's dead now, and
this is a good, big house. It would be a palace
for the Mulvaneys. Who owns it?"</p>

<p>"The same man who allowed the poor old
lunatic to have it for a home. He's queer,
too. I never said anything but 'good morning,'
or 'how do you do' to him in my
life."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, just a little way from here around
the next corner on the Bay Shore road."</p>

<p>"What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Welcome Hodgkins."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's the Hodgkins district, is he?"</p>

<p>"No," laughed Cornelia, "not exactly, although
his ancestors gave the district its
name. I tell you he's a queer old fellow—the
only Hodgkins left in the country. I
really shouldn't like to call on him, but we'll
do it if you think the Mulvaneys would live
here, and if you'll do the talking."</p>

<p>"Well, come on then," said Sally.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sally, but my heart is set on teaching
school this summer; I do hope they'll
come. Yes, I'll go with you to see Mr.
Hodgkins. We'll walk. He has the best
farm in the country but I tell you he's queer;
nobody ever goes to see him. He lives in
that large white house straight ahead."</p>

<p>"But, Cornelia Mary, the blinds are all
closed. I don't believe he's at home."</p>

<p>"That's nothing, Sally, he lives alone in
the back of his house. I told you he was
queer."</p>

<p>"Where's his wife?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>"Dead, years ago."</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, come in," said Mr.
Hodgkins, opening wide his kitchen door, at
the girls' timid knock.</p>

<p>The man's eyes were so kind and he smiled
so pleasantly Sally liked him.</p>

<p>"We've come on an important errand, Mr.
Hodgkins," she began. "It's about Cornelia's
school. Unless you will help us,
Cornelia Mary can't teach school this summer."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" questioned Mr. Hodgkins. "I
shall certainly be pleased to do all in my
power to assist the young lady."</p>

<p>Sally told him the story of the Mulvaneys.
When she finished speaking there was silence
for a moment. "Guess he is queer," thought
Sally. Mr. Hodgkins's first remark was unsatisfactory,
to say the least.</p>

<p>"Oom—um—I dunno," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Is it about the rent?" Sally inquired.</p>

<p>"Ooom—um," replied Mr. Hodgkins.</p>

<p>"Unless you wanted too much money,"
continued the child, "I think she could manage
it. She has to pay rent where they live
now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>At that Welcome Hodgkins found his
voice. "It's the children," he confessed.
"They could have the house and welcome,
but I can't say as I relish having the young
savages raising Cain on my farm."</p>

<p>"It seems to me they could be trained,"
faltered Sally.</p>

<p>Something in her tone troubled Welcome
Hodgkins. "Come with me and see the
house," he suggested, "and we'll consider the
matter."</p>

<p>For the first time in years spring sunshine
streamed across the threshold of the lonely
dwelling among the bushes. Once more the
old rooms echoed a childish voice and footsteps
from the outside world.</p>

<p>"It's not a bad sort of a house after all,"
remarked the owner, having lighted the lamp
he carried. "Musty and damp now to be
sure, but it's roomy and might easily be repaired.
Well, I dunno, let them come and if
they misbehave, we'll train them."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hodgkins, you're an awful nice man,
and Mrs. Mulvaney'll say so too, when she
gets my letter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>"I don't know how to thank you," added
Cornelia Mary.</p>

<p>"Well, children, here's the key. I'll unboard
the windows any time you give the
word. I'm thinking, Miss Cornelia Mary,
that you and I will have our hands full this
summer. Good day."</p>

<p>"Isn't he a nice man?" whispered Sally,
as Welcome Hodgkins sauntered homeward.</p>

<p>"Oom—um—I dunno," was the response.
"I still think he's queer."</p>

<span class="small">TOM MAKES A SUGGESTION</span>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> one in the Randall family became
interested in the fortunes of the Mulvaneys.
Even the hired man offered his services in
getting the house ready for the new tenants.</p>

<p>"Like enough a little fresh paint'd be a
good thing," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Fresh paint," repeated Tom, "yes, sir,
that's just the thing to furnish a house with.
If I couldn't have but one piece of furniture,
I'd take fresh paint. I wouldn't say give me
a bed, or a table, or a chair, or a small article
like a kitchen stove; no, sir, I'd say, fresh
paint for me, if you please, fresh paint or
nothing."</p>

<p>"Tom, you are the most consoling mortal,"
interrupted Cornelia Mary. "We completely
forgot about the furniture."</p>

<p>"Jake didn't, though; he knew that as

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>

long as the Mulvaneys had fresh paint they'd
be all right. Now, who'll give the paint?
Corny, you ought to do it, because think of
the salary you'll earn teaching that school."</p>

<p>"Hold on, young man," said Mr. Randall,
"Jake's idea is good, and I'll donate all the
paint he'll put on."</p>

<p>"Father has a lot left from painting the
barn," Cornelia Mary whispered to Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p>"They may have our old kitchen stove,
too," added Mrs. Randall. "It's a nice little
stove, but we've had no use for it since we
bought the range, and it's in the woodshed
covered with rust. I should be glad to get
it out of the way."</p>

<p>Without warning Tom stood on his head
and waved his feet in the air.</p>

<p>"Tom Randall, what possesses you?"
asked his mother, giving the pillows on the
sitting-room couch a vigorous shake.</p>

<p>"I wish to speak in meeting," explained
Tom. "It's no circus performance. Cheer
up, Corny, I'll teach the Mulvaneys how to
raise their feet instead of their hands when
they have to ask questions in school."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>"I'll give you a new lesson in shingling if
you try it," observed his father, laughing
with the rest of the family at the change of
expression on Tom's face.</p>

<p>"I was about to make a suggestion," Tom
continued. "Now don't giggle, Corny and
Sally, I'm serious. I say let's go furniture-hunting
all through the country."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, you dear!" exclaimed Cornelia
Mary. "The very thing! I suppose
every one of our neighbours has old furniture
in their woodsheds and attics they would be
glad to get rid of."</p>

<p>Sally clapped her hands and tried to speak.
She had barely time to open her mouth before
Cornelia Mary had finished a request.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, will you go with us? We'll
hitch Bess to the lumber wagon and you
drive. Will you?"</p>

<p>Tom considered a moment, as became his
dignity, before replying. "I'll go on one
condition. If mother and father and Mrs.
Brown will let us all stay home from school,
we'll begin to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, let them," begged Cornelia Mary,
"do say yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>Permission was given, to the great surprise
of Master Tom.</p>

<p>"But he's such a tease," objected Sally.</p>

<p>"You're only half-acquainted with Tom,"
declared his sister. "He has streaks of real
goodness, and when he says he'll help, he
always does it."</p>

<p>Bess must have thought picnics had begun
early when Tom, Cornelia Mary, and Sally
scrambled into the lumber wagon the following
morning. They laughed so much, and
acted so generally foolish, the old horse
turned her head several times, as if she
couldn't understand the occasion for such
hilarity.</p>

<p>"We must ask for left over rolls of wall
paper," suggested Cornelia Mary. "Jake
and father promised to open the house to-day.
They are going to put up the stove
and build a fire. Mother says that old crazy
man was neat as wax, and that the relatives
left the house in perfect order after the
funeral."</p>

<p>"How many rooms in the shebang?"
questioned Tom.</p>

<p>"Let me think; there's a sitting-room, a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>

bedroom, a dining-room, and a kitchen downstairs.
I think Mr. Hodgkins said there
were three rooms upstairs, didn't he, Sally?"</p>

<p>"Yes, three rooms, and kind of an attic
over the kitchen. Oh, what will the Mulvaneys
think? They have only two little
rooms and a place above for the children to
sleep, where they live, and the children were
never in a decent house in their lives. They
are not used to furniture, let me tell you.
They didn't own but one real bed."</p>

<p>The first donation was a what-not, given
by Mrs. George Saunders.</p>

<p>"That thing'll be a comfort," commented
Tom.</p>

<p>"It'll help fix up the sitting-room," commented
Cornelia Mary.</p>

<p>"What's it for?" asked Sally.</p>

<p>"To stand in the corner," was the reply.
"You're supposed to put pretty things on the
shelves."</p>

<p>"Hope nobody'll give us another," faltered
Sally.</p>

<p>Deacon Trowbridge happened to be thinking
of buying new furniture. He was glad
to help load his old lounge, two arm-chairs,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>

and a marble-topped table upon the lumber
wagon.</p>

<p>"Furniture's picking up," remarked Tom
as he drove on.</p>

<p>Before the day was done the old horse was
resting her feet in the barn, while the Randall
family, including grandfather and the
hired man were examining second-hand furniture
in the woodshed.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have believed it possible," said
Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>"Nor I," Mrs. Randall added. "Do you
see the lace curtains! And if there isn't Mrs.
Moses Pendleton's old sewing-machine! I
didn't suppose she'd give a thing. How did
it happen, Cornelia Mary?"</p>

<p>"You see, mamma, I knew that woman
had two machines because I was there the
day the new one was brought home, and I
suppose she guessed what I was thinking
about when Sally told the story."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I'm getting sick of telling that
old story," laughed Sally. "I'll be glad when
we get through collecting furniture."</p>

<p>The hired man kept his word. With a
great deal of advice and more or less help

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>

from the children, he painted, papered, and
got the house in order inside and out. Many
of the neighbours assisted with the work of
settling, then went home to ransack their
attics afresh to supply newly discovered
needs.</p>

<p>In the village Mrs. Isaac Turner used her
influence. Through her efforts a barrel of
flour and a box of groceries found their way
to the Mulvaney pantry. Tubs and a wash-boiler
were purchased by the future school
teacher. Inspired by her example Tom made
a wash-bench. It was a good one, too,
strong and heavy. Mrs. Brown bought the
material and Sally hemmed towels. Mrs.
Randall provided sheets while Mr. Randall
gave a generous load of wood.</p>

<p>At last, when all was ready, Sally wrote
to Mrs. Mulvaney.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span></p>
</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br /><br />
<span class="small">SOMETHING HAPPENED</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would be hard to say who was more
surprised by Sally's letter, the postman or
Mrs. Mulvaney. Both stared doubtfully at
the envelope, the postman appearing unwilling
to leave the letter, while Mrs. Mulvaney
was equally uncertain of her right to it. The
children were out. When the postman was
gone their mother put a stick of wood in the
kitchen stove, poked the clothes in the boiler,
glanced at the wash-tubs, then went in the
Other Room.</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" she remarked, turning
the envelope over and over before opening it.
"I wonder what Mulvaney would think!"</p>

<p>Three times while Mrs. Mulvaney was
reading the letter she opened and closed her
mouth without uttering a sound. The fourth
time she managed to say, "Well I never!"

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>

At last she returned to the wash-boiler and
poked the clothes so vigorously it is a wonder
she didn't punch holes through them. Next
she made an attack on the wash-tub. She
flipped, flapped, and jerked the clothes over
the board, pounded on the soap, and worked
with such energy Johnnie didn't dare enter
the kitchen. He always peeped in the window
before venturing further.</p>

<p>"She'd spank us," he murmured, running
to warn his brothers and sisters to "keep
back."</p>

<p>It was well that he did so. His mother
was in no mood to be trifled with. In the
shortest possible time the washing was finished
and hung on the line.</p>

<p>"Now then," said Mrs. Mulvaney, going
in the Other Room and searching under the
bed for an old stocking which she dragged
forth quickly, "we'll see."</p>

<p>"More in it than I thought," she went on,
pouring the contents in her lap, then rapidly
counting the money. "Eight tickets! It
won't take long to find out what they'll cost.
I'll go to the Grand Central Station and
price them. Where's my good skirt?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>The garment was easily found. It was on
the floor in the corner with soiled clothes and
various other articles. Mrs. Mulvaney slipped
it over her working-dress unmindful of apron
strings sticking through the placket hole in
the back.</p>

<p>"Now my bonnet," she continued. Mrs.
Mulvaney owned a bonnet, but where to look
for it was perplexing. She found it under
the bed, then twisted her hair in a tighter
knot before putting it on. Finding her shawl
was a harder matter, until Mrs. Mulvaney
recalled having placed it over the dishpan in
which the bread was rising, or trying to rise.</p>

<p>"Now I'm ready; I wonder where the
young ones are? Hannah, Hannah Mulvaney?"
she called from the kitchen door,
"step lively, you're all to come in this minute."</p>

<p>Obedience was a shining virtue in the Mulvaney
family. The children came.</p>

<p>"Why, ma," protested Mike, "you ain't
going to leave us, I hope."</p>

<p>By way of reply Mrs. Mulvaney jerked
Mike through the doorway, knocking him
against Johnnie with such force the little

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>

fellow sat down in the dishpan containing the
uncovered bread dough.</p>

<p>"Don't stir out of this house while I'm
gone," commanded Mrs. Mulvaney, sailing
away without looking behind, which was a
fortunate thing for Johnnie. Before his
mother's return he had scraped off most of
the dough from his trousers, with the help
of the twins.</p>

<p>"Kind o' sthicky, ain't it?" commented
Stubbins, tasting of the dough. "Thay! I'd
give a thent to know where ma went."</p>

<p>"Maybe she ain't never coming back,"
suggested Hannah, after a long silence.</p>

<p>"Yes she is; look alive, kids," shouted
Chinky, "she's coming like the fire engine.
Watch out!"</p>

<p>"I bet she's been after a policeman, and
we'll all get took to jail," whispered Johnnie,
looking for a place to hide and finding none.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Mulvaney returned she said
nothing at first, and the children were too
frightened by her behaviour to dare speak.
They didn't know what to think as they
watched their mother count eight green slips
of paper which she afterward pinned inside

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>

her dress. The next astonishing performance
was the writing of a postal card which
the woman straightway mailed.</p>

<p>"Whath going to happen?" questioned
Stubbins. No one knew.</p>

<p>"My thaketh!" was a later exclamation
from Stubbins. "My thaketh alive! Here
cometh the thecond-hand man with ma!"</p>

<p>Even his errand was a mystery to the
seven, as before he was invited in, the children
were turned out.</p>

<p>That night when Chinky carried the washing
home, he told the customer that it was
the last work his mother would ever do for
her.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded the woman.</p>

<p>"Can't prove it by me," was the reply, "I
dunno no more about it'n you do."</p>

<p>The next morning the second-hand man
called at eight, and carried away the stove,
the wash-boiler, the tubs, Mrs. Mulvaney's
bed and bureau, the few chairs, in fact everything
that he could possibly sell. By this
time the children were absolutely terrified.</p>

<p>"We're going to move!" announced their
mother. "What's more, we're going to have

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>

a ride on the cars. You must all wash up
and I'll tidy your hair. Then we'll get ready
to start. We ain't got a trunk to pack things
in, but we've got pa's satchel. Eight of us
ought to carry what's left here in our hands."</p>

<p>"How'll we take all the clothes that was
give to us Christmas?" asked Hannah.</p>

<p>"You'll wear 'em," was the reply. "You
ain't got but three dresses to your name, and
if you can't get 'em all on, you ain't good
for much. Thin as you be, I don't know but
you'll hold more clothes than just your own.
We'll see."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulvaney began on poor Stubbins.
He was plump and given to stumbling anyway,
but by the time his mother had squeezed
him into two suits and three overcoats of
various sizes, he could scarcely wiggle, nor
could he bend his arms.</p>

<p>"I'll tie up a little bundle of stuff for you
to carry in one hand," said Mrs. Mulvaney,
"and you can take the clothes-stick in the
other. It's too good to leave behind. Now
don't you stir," she continued, "until the
others are ready."</p>

<p>"Well, ma," grumbled Stubbins, "I

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>

couldn't sthir if I wanted to. I sthick out all
around ith like a pig. I thay! I'm too
warm!"</p>

<p>Mike laughed at Stubbins, so Mrs. Mulvaney
chose him for the next victim. He
quickly felt and looked like his little brother.</p>

<p>"You can take the kerosene can in one
hand, and the dishpan in the other," said
Mrs. Mulvaney. Then Mike felt worse than
Stubbins, but protest was useless. He had to
carry the kerosene can and the old dishpan.</p>

<p>Johnnie looked too pleased, whereupon he
was taken in hand,—"rigged out," as his
mother said. "You can carry the wash-board,"
she went on, "it's almost as good as
new; I don't care what the second-hand man
had to say."</p>

<p>"Oh, ma," besought Johnnie, "let Chinky
carry the wash-board, he's bigger. I might
fall and break it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulvaney was so in the habit of
spanking Johnnie she began as usual, before
she thought how well padded he was.</p>

<p>"Thay, ma, you'll have to thlap him," advised
Stubbins. "He ith only got hith
fathe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>"Lucky for once," chuckled Mike. Even
Mrs. Mulvaney laughed.</p>

<p>In the meantime Hannah made clothes-racks
of Nora and Dora. Fearing she might
have to carry the rusty tin pails herself, she
asked her mother what she wished to put in
them for the twins to take.</p>

<p>"Provisions," was the reply, "you can
pack up the bread and whatever's left in the
cupboards. Get your own extra clothes on

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>

right lively now. You're to carry pa's picture.
The frame ain't heavy and you know
how to be careful."</p>

<p>"Maybe I better take the pails an' you
carry the picture," objected Hannah. "I'm
afraid I might spoil it. It's all I can do to
manage my arms on 'count of so many
sleeves."</p>

<p>"I'll take the picture," offered Chinky,
trying to evade the mop, broom, clothes-line,
pole, and clothes-pin basket his mother thrust
upon him.</p>

<p>"You'll carry what I say," declared Mrs.
Mulvaney, putting on all the garments she
owned. Then she packed Mr. Mulvaney's
old satchel so full the sides burst.</p>

<p>"I can tie it up," said she, tearing a strip
from a ragged blanket for the purpose. "I'll
have to carry pa's satchel and make these
quilts and things into a bundle. There now!
there are two of your pa's old coats. Who'll
take 'em? Can't carry 'em, you say, got your
hands full? I'll fix it, Chinky, you can wear
one and Hannah can wear the other. Hold
still and I'll button them around you.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>

They're just short enough so they won't
drag."</p>

<p>"Look here, ma?" offered Chinky, "you
roll 'em up in a tight bundle and I guess I
can carry 'em after all."</p>

<p>"I thought you could manage," agreed
Mrs. Mulvaney. "You see we're going
where I may get some time to do fancy
work, and I'm thinking of making rugs of
pa's old coats to remember him by."</p>

<p>"Oh, ma, look at us!" wailed Hannah
when the procession was ready to start.
"Have we got to go looking like this?"</p>

<p>"I don't see no other way and you needn't
feel bad, Hannah, because we don't look stylish.
You may be a school teacher some day,"
predicted her mother. "Fact is we're all going
to have a chance to be folks, and if I
was you young ones, I'd try and forget what
we look like now, and think hard about how
fine we'll look next time we go on the cars
with our trunks and umbrells and land knows
what; and when we all get set down in the
Grand Central Station to wait for the cars,
I'll tell you where we're going and all about
it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>"Thaketh alive, ma! it don't theem ath if
I could ever get there with tho many thingth
on, and thay! but you look—"</p>

<p>"You start your boots," interrupted the
mother of Stubbins, "or you'll feel worse'n
you look."</p>

<span class="small">HOW STUBBINS WENT TO SEE MR. HODGKINS</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom Randall</span>, Cornelia Mary, and Sally
met the Mulvaneys with a lumber wagon. In
spite of all Cornelia Mary could do to prevent
such actions, Tom fairly shouted when
he saw the family lifted from the train by the
grinning brakeman, while Sally's face was
the colour of a poppy as she went forward to
greet her friends. It wasn't easy to claim the
Mulvaneys in the presence of the amused passengers,
whose faces filled the car windows.
It was a relief to hear the engine whistle and
see the train start.</p>

<p>"We're going right straight to your
house," Sally told Mrs. Mulvaney. "Mamma
is there this morning waiting for you. Why
won't the children talk? What's the matter?
Have they lost their tongues?"</p>

<p>"They never was on the cars before," explained

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>

Mrs. Mulvaney, "and they behaved
real well. They act kind of bashful now."
Whereupon the seven looked foolish, and
wouldn't speak to Sally. Even Stubbins was
dumb.</p>

<p>"This is your new teacher," Sally continued
by way of introducing the family, "and
that boy on the front seat is her brother Tom.
Climb in, children. Where will you sit, Mrs.
Mulvaney?"</p>

<p>"I'll just hist myself on to the front seat
with the boy," was the reply, and that must
have been the reason Tom drove home by
way of Park's Corner instead of through the
village.</p>

<p>"Why, Tom," remonstrated Cornelia
Mary, "it's three miles farther the road
you've started on!"</p>

<p>"Want to give your school a chance to
see the country," was the response. "Geddap,
geddap!"</p>

<p>"This spring air won't hurt anybody," Sally
put in. "Oh, Hannah, isn't it lovely? Aren't
you ever going to talk again, Hannah?"</p>

<p>Not a word from Hannah. Stubbins was
the first to find his voice. "Oh, pigth, pigth,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>

thop the horthe!" he cried. "Thay, boy, I
want to thee the pigth!"</p>

<p>"Whoa!" said Tom. "Didn't you ever
see pigs before, Stubbins?"</p>

<p>"Yeth, but I never thaw pigth in the country,
did I?"</p>

<p>"Do you like pigs?"</p>

<p>"I geth I do! Are they pigth where we
are going?"</p>

<p>"Giddap," repeated Tom, pulling at the
reins, and then turning so that he could look
at Stubbins he said this:</p>

<p>"Pigs? Why, I should say yes! Look
here, Stubbins, there are so many pigs in the
country they run wild—wild, I say, and if
any little kid is a pig catcher all he's got to
do is catch a pig and keep it if he can. You
can even take pigs to school here, ride 'em
right into the schoolhouse if the door's open."</p>

<p>Stubbins glanced inquiringly at Cornelia
Mary, but she and Sally were busy talking
with Mike and Johnnie, while Chinky and
Hannah were busy listening to them. Mrs.
Mulvaney was thinking, and paid no attention
to Tom's nonsense.</p>

<p>"Thay, boy," suggested Stubbins, "leth

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>

thop the horthe and go back and get thome
pigth now."</p>

<p>"Haven't time," was the reply, "plenty of
wild pigs all through the country; you'll want
something to do when you get home."</p>

<p>During the rest of the drive, Stubbins
hugged his bundle and dreamed of pigs, and
after a few minutes' silence Tom entertained
Mrs. Mulvaney with stories of the house in
which she was to live.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't stay in that house over night
for one thousand dollars!" he remarked.</p>

<p>"Land sake, why not?" asked the woman.</p>

<p>In low tones lest Cornelia Mary should
overhear, Tom did his best to scare Mrs. Mulvaney.
He told nothing but the truth, but
he handled the truth in such a way Mrs. Mulvaney
felt cold chills going up and down her
back in spite of all the clothes she had on.
At last she spoke.</p>

<p>"Now that's enough, young man," she
said, "and if I ever catch you telling my
young ones any of that stuff, I'll shake some
sense into you. You'll be more rattled-headed
than you are now, if I ever lay hands on
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>"Giddap," remarked Tom, astonished for
once in his life.</p>

<p>If Heaven had opened to receive the Mulvaneys,
they could scarcely have been more
pleased than when the new home was reached.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon Stubbins slipped
away from the family and went in search of
wild pigs. Tom was right. Back of the house
was a field of small pigs. Stubbins gave a
shout of joy and started in pursuit. He
caught a little pig easily, and carried it, kicking
and squealing, to his new home.</p>

<p>The family were in the sitting-room and
didn't hear Stubbins when he carried the pig
through the kitchen, the dining-room, and up
the stairs. Into the attic over the kitchen he
thrust the pig, then returned to the field for
another. In less than an hour, five pigs were
in that attic and Stubbins was happy.</p>

<p>"Now I think I thaw a nithe big pig
thomewhere," he remarked, climbing a fence,
and looking carefully over the fields of his
neighbour. Welcome Hodgkins. Sure enough!
Beyond the field in which he caught the five
was one big pig. Away flew Stubbins. It

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span>

wouldn't be so easy to get that pig home because
it was too big to carry.</p>

<p>"Come, pig, pig, pig," called Stubbins,
"nithe piggie, come pig."</p>

<p>The nice pig looked up, and said, "Ooof—oof—oof!
Ugh—ugh—ugh!"</p>

<p>Stubbins ventured nearer, but the pig took
alarm and trotted grunting across the field.
The pig had four legs and Stubbins only two
rather uncertain ones; nevertheless, after
rather an exciting chase, the pig was caught.</p>

<p>"Now, mithter, how will I get you home?
Hold sthill; here, I geth I'll have to get on
and ride the way that boy thed. Geddap over
to the gate. Hold sthill till I get hold of your
ear. Wait, I thay!"</p>

<p>The pig wouldn't wait, and Stubbins
wouldn't let go. Clinging to the creature's
ears, he somehow managed to scramble on its
back. Then began a wild ride.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="A_WILD_RIDE">
  <img src="images/image052.png" width="600" height="396"
alt="Illustration of Stubbins on the pig's back."/>
</div>

<p>"I didn't know a pig could go tho fatht,"
gasped Stubbins, hanging on for dear life,
while the pig squealed and squealed and
squealed. "Why, thay! What you trying to
do, pig?" grumbled Stubbins, as the animal

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>

began rubbing him against the fence corner.
"Oh, I thay, get out of thith!"</p>

<p>The pig got out, but he made straight for
the barnyard where Welcome Hodgkins was
feeding the chickens. There was a scattering
of poultry as the pig dashed beneath a wagon
in the middle of the yard, landing Stubbins—bump—swish!
on his back in the mud.</p>

<p>"Sthop the pig," cried Stubbins, struggling
to his feet, "sthop my pig I thay!"</p>

<p>"See here, youngster, that's my pig!" declared

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>

Welcome Hodgkins. "Who are you,
anyway, and what are you trying to do with
my pig?"</p>

<p>"I'm Thubbinth, and I wath taking the pig
to my houthe. I didn't know it wath your
pig, and I didn't come to thee you, tho there!"</p>

<span class="small">PIGS IN THE ATTIC</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Stubbins Mulvaney</span> was naturally honest.
Mr. Welcome Hodgkins was kind. So it
came about that when the man talked pleasantly
to the muddy boy about the rights of
farmers and the ownership of pigs in particular,
the child grew red in the face and
looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Thay!" he burst out, "I geth I thole
five pigth. That boy thed pigth wath wild,
tho I took thome home. I put 'em up sthairth,
where they'd keep thafe. Do you th'pothe
they wath your pigth?"</p>

<p>"Of course they were my pigs," replied
the man, "and you must take them carefully
back to the field. Wait a minute! If you
go to your mother all covered with mud I'll
warrant you'll get spanked."</p>

<p>"Thath nothing," was the reply, "ma ith

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>

uthed to mud and if I get thpanked I ith uthed
to that, tho ith all right. Thay! I like pigs.
Do you care if I thee you feed your pigth?"</p>

<p>"Certainly you may, and I'll tell you what,
youngster," said Mr. Hodgkins, "I believe
you're a pretty good boy. After you put the
five pigs where they belong, you come over
and have a talk with me, will you?"</p>

<p>"Yeth, thir," and Stubbins left the barnyard
fast as he could go, except by riding a
pig bareback.</p>

<p>In the meantime the five pigs in the attic
had been playing Pussy Wants a Corner,
or Tag, or some other game that kept their
twenty feet continually pattering. Sally noticed
them first.</p>

<p>"Hush, everybody," she cautioned. "I
thought I heard something go trot—trot—trot
right here in the house."</p>

<p>Sure enough. When the children stopped
their merry chatter, the sound of many feet
could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>"Stubbins is up to something," said Mrs.
Mulvaney. "Go call him, Hannah."</p>

<p>The child obeyed, but no Stubbins responded
inside or outside of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>"It ain't Stubbins," declared Hannah, her
eyes wide with fear. "What can it be?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulvaney, Cornelia Mary, and Sally
remembered the stories they had heard, stories
that had kept the house empty so many years.</p>

<p>"It must—must be imagination," declared
Cornelia Mary, whose lower teeth seemed trying
to break her upper teeth.</p>

<p>"We've all got ears," remonstrated Chinky.</p>

<p>"It's Stubbins," insisted Mrs. Mulvaney,
"and I'll give it to him for being so smart
and not answering Hannah."</p>

<p>Upstairs went Mrs. Mulvaney, but she came
down faster than she went up. "It beats all,"
she declared, "there ain't nobody in the house
but us—and do you hear that noise again?
I ain't afraid, but when I opened the attic
door I heard some one cough, and then he
laughed, though it sounded more like a
squeal."</p>

<p>"Listen, now," faltered Sally, "hear that
trot—trot—trot, again?"</p>

<p>Being a woman of action, Mrs. Mulvaney
lighted a lamp. "I'm going in that attic and
look around," said she. "I don't care if you
all come along."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>"I ain't afraid," bragged Chinky.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue," said his mother, leading
the way toward the attic.</p>

<p>Neither Cornelia Mary nor Sally could
have spoken had they tried. Their jaws
wouldn't work. As for their knees, one minute
they were stiff as the joints of a Dutch
doll, the next the poor girls could scarcely
stand. Johnnie was whimpering. Hannah
and the twins clung together. Only Mike and
Chinky pretended not to be afraid, as Mrs.
Mulvaney climbed steadily upward. By the
attic door she paused, surrounded by her followers.</p>

<p>"Trot—trot—trot—patter—patter—patter,"
a shuffling sound, then all was still.</p>

<p>"Open the door, Chinky, and step in,"
whispered Mrs. Mulvaney.</p>

<p>"You go first, ma, 'cause you got the
light," begged Chinky. Mrs. Mulvaney boxed
his ears, and as the sound was repeated
in the attic, it didn't make it easier for Chinky
to open the door. His mother pushed him in.</p>

<p>"Now what do you see?" she said.</p>

<p>"Nothing," chattered the boy, his very
freckles growing pale beneath the lamp light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>It happened that the pigs were hiding behind
a box back of the chimney. One gave a
little thin squeal just as the light was blown
out. Another said "Oof—oof!" Mike
and Chinky bolted down the stairs. They
thought the pig said, "Boo—boo!" only of
course they didn't know they fled from the
voice of a pig.</p>

<p>When Stubbins reached home the house
was still. The family were shivering in the
sitting-room, talking in whispers.</p>

<p>"Let's keep still and see what Stubbins
says," suggested Sally. "Why, he's going
upstairs!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulvaney and the children ran into
the dining-room, but scarcely had they crossed
the threshold before the pigs began to squeal,
and Stubbins was heard shouting:</p>

<p>"Hold sthill, pig, hold sthill! Thay!
Wait! Ith tho dark you make me bump my
head."</p>

<p>"I'll bump your head," called Mrs. Mulvaney.
"What are you doing with pigs in
this nice, new house, you bad boy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 59-60]</span></p>

<div class="caption">"A CLEANER IF NOT A BETTER BOY."</div>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>

<p>"Oh, ma, don't sthpank me, I thought they
wath wild pigth, and I put 'em here tho they'd
be thafe, but I thed I'd take 'em back."</p>

<p>After much squealing and kicking the five
pigs were caught and carried to the field by
Hannah, Chinky, Nora, Dora and Johnnie.
Stubbins was needed in the kitchen where he
was given what you might call a double spanking;
one for taking the pigs, the second for
scaring his mother.</p>

<p>The spanking finished, Stubbins was asked
to tell about his meeting with Welcome Hodgkins.
The child repeated every word. Mrs.
Mulvaney listened quietly until her young son
confessed that he said his mother was used
to dirt. Then she spanked him until the
dishes rattled in the cupboard. After that
Mrs. Mulvaney put different clothes on Stubbins,
scrubbed his hands and face until the
skin was raw, brushed his hair so hard his
head swam, and sent him a cleaner if not a
better boy, to call on Welcome Hodgkins.</p>

<p>"You can't be folks unless you keep looking
decent," declared Mrs. Mulvaney, "and
don't you ever let me know of your telling
the neighbours that your mother's used to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span>

dirt, or I may put you in the boiler and boil
you clean next time."</p>

<p>That is the way Mr. Hodgkins was led to
believe that Mrs. Mulvaney was an uncommonly
neat woman, the day he and Stubbins
became friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little</span> by little Mrs. Mulvaney remembered
her old country home. Little by little
the springtime breezes, sweet and fresh,
smoothed the wrinkles from her brow, and
softened her voice.</p>

<p>"Thay, ma," declared Stubbins one Sunday
morning, when the birds were singing
from every swaying branch, and the green
world seemed bursting with joy, "Thay, do

<p>Here Hannah put in a few words. "Ma,
I do wish you had a best dress. We live in
such a nice house and everything, I wish—"</p>

<p>"Go on, Stubbins," interrupted Mrs. Mulvaney,
"what did Mr. Hodgkins say?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>"He thay he thinkth I've got a awful nithe

<p>"Pshaw, now, what makes him think so?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>"Stubbins," questioned Mrs. Mulvaney
with a curious look in her eyes as she gazed
over the broad fields and orchards belonging
to Mr. Welcome Hodgkins, "What does he
say when you young ones tell him that I'm—that
I'm apt to be cross, and that you get
all the spankings you deserve, hey?"</p>

<p>Stubbins laughed. "Thay, ma, do you
th'pothe uth kidth ever tell about our lickunth?
Well, I geth not! You mutht think we're

<p>Mrs. Mulvaney caught Stubbins by the
shoulders and shook him. "You simpleton!"
said she, "why didn't you know enough to
tell him your real name slipped your memory,
that your folks called you Stubbins when you
were little because you were always stubbing
your unlucky toes."</p>

<p>"Why, ma!" protested Hannah, "He

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span>

never was named; you know Stubbins is the
only name he's got."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulvaney threw her slipper at Hannah.
"You know a lot, don't you, Miss?
Now listen, all of you. Johnnie, Mike, come
here. You seem to have forgotten this boy's
name."</p>

<p>"He ain't never had no name," declared
Johnnie, dodging behind Chinky to escape the
spanking he seemed to expect when his mother
looked at him as she did at that moment.</p>

<p>"You donkeys!" exclaimed Mrs. Mulvaney.
"Dust out your ears now and you'll
hear something. Stubbins's real name is
Moses Aaron Mulvaney. Do you hear, Stubbins?
Your meetin'-house name is Moses.
When you start school, your name is Moses.
When a man asks who you are, answer Moses.
Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Oh, oh," wailed Stubbins, "Oh, thaketh
alive, my name ith Motheth! Oh, thay, ma,
I don't want Motheth for my name. Motheth,
Motheth, Motheth!"</p>

<p>"Oh, ma," besought Hannah, "think up
another. Don't let's have that for his name.
Let's call him Willie or—"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>"Hannah," insisted Mrs. Mulvaney, "that
boy's name is Moses Aaron Mulvaney. You
can't change names. Maybe now you'd like
to be called Aribella or Fiddle-de-dee, but
you're Hannah and he's Moses!"</p>

<p>"Oh. Motheth, Motheth, Motheth!"
grumbled Stubbins. "Oh, thaketh alive,
Motheth!"</p>

<p>"What's Chink's name, ma?" demanded
Mike, with a gleeful grin which lasted but
a minute, owing to a pinch from Chinky
which changed the expression of his face.
"Ouw—" he began.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" warned Chinky, "don't you
know enough to keep your mouth shut?"</p>

<p>"Yeth," said Stubbins, "if I've got to be
Motheth, who ith he?"</p>

<p>"Don't you remember?" asked Mrs. Mulvaney,
"why, Chinky's name is Ezra Jonathan."</p>

<p>"Ezra Jonathan!" groaned Chinky, his
red hair and freckles looking startled. "Oh,
ma!"</p>

<p>"The idea of trying to be folks and not
knowing your own names. I guess you'll remember
'em now, Moses Aaron and Ezra

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>

Jonathan. Not's I care what Mr. Hodgkins
thinks, 'cause it's none of his business what
your names are. But just the same you want
to do everything you can to keep on the right
side of him on account of our living in his
house. You make yourselves useful to him
and don't never be sassy or he might turn us
out. Mind that. You show him what a comfort
children can be, don't never do what he
don't want you to, and always do what he
tells you to."</p>

<p>Five children cheerfully promised to do as
their mother advised, but poor Chinky and
Stubbins simply grunted an assent, followed
a minute later by two exclamations.</p>

<p>"Ezra Jonathan!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Motheth!"</p>

<span class="small">HANNAH'S PINK DRESS</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Summer</span> came, and the Mulvaneys prospered.
Their garden grew and the neglected
fruit-trees flourished. Mr. Hodgkins gave
Stubbins two pigs, and the twins were given
a flock of hens, whereupon Chinky earned
some money, bought two turkeys, and by the
time three of the hens were ready to set, his
turkeys did the same thing; and the curious
part of it is that each one of the eggs hatched,
and every little chicken and little turkey lived.</p>

<p>Often when Chinky was tired of weeding
the garden or hoeing corn, he sat upon the
fence and counted the money he hoped to
possess in the autumn when he took his turkeys
to market. If his mother saw him wasting
his time, he was obliged to continue his
thinking while he worked.</p>

<p>"Ma's getting so she won't let a feller stop

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span>

to wink," Johnnie grumbled one morning,
when he was Chairman of the Committee on
Potato Bugs.</p>

<p>"She's a regular general," added Chinky,
hoeing corn with all his might, "and you
young ones'll get cured of being so lazy."</p>

<p>"Lazy, is it?" retorted Mike. "You go
look at the front yard, mister, and say lazy
if you dare, and you ain't afraid of getting
your nose punched."</p>

<p>"That's what," agreed Johnnie, "the minute
we get home from school, it's 'have you
done this,' and 'have you done that,' and
'start your boots!'"</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
Johnnie Mulvaney!" began Hannah, but she
stopped for a minute because seeing her open
mouth, Mike threw a potato bug into the cavern.</p>

<p>"You horrid boy," she sputtered, "I'd
make you work harder'n ma does if I could,
and you'll be sorry next week when I ain't
here!"</p>

<p>"Why, thay, Hannah, where you going?"
asked Stubbins.</p>

<p>"I'm going away, and you boys'll have to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>

make the beds and tidy up, and wash the
dishes, and I'm glad of it. Wish I was never
coming back. You're such a ungrateful set."</p>

<p>At the end of this speech Hannah was so
pelted with potato bugs she fled from the field.
The next day the little girl left home to earn
fifty cents a week for two months helping in
Mrs. Randall's kitchen.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the Randalls had all the
help they needed, but from the first day of
school, Cornelia Mary had taken a fancy to
Hannah, and had begged her mother to give
the child a chance to learn how their neighbours
lived. So, while Hannah washed dishes
for fifty cents a week, she learned how to
wash dishes properly. When she helped set
the table and get the meals, she saw how such
things should be done. When she made the
beds with Cornelia Mary, she began to understand
how sheets were used.</p>

<p>As the days went by, even the five little
Mulvaneys who met Hannah in school every
day, noticed a change in their sister. She outgrew
her rude way of speaking, and looked
and acted like a different girl. She kept her
hair combed prettily, proud of the bright ribbons

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>

given her by Cornelia Mary. She
learned to sew on buttons, and to keep her
clothes in order.</p>

<p>"Straight, plain dresses aren't meant for
thin little girls," observed Mrs. Randall, "so
we'll make over some of Cornelia Mary's old
ones for Hannah."</p>

<p>The first Sunday Hannah wore one of the
new dresses she blossomed out like a full
blown rose.</p>

<p>"Run home and show your mother, child,"
said Mrs. Randall.</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" exclaimed Mrs. Mulvaney,
as the pink blossom joined her family
beneath an apple-tree. "If she don't look
like a posy with the pink bow on her hair,
and such a splendiferous dress. Well, there
now! I suppose you won't never want to
come back to live with your poor old ma."</p>

<p>"Won't I, though?" For the first time in
her life Hannah Mulvaney threw both arms
around her mother's neck, giving her a regular
bear hug.</p>

<p>At that moment Welcome Hodgkins was
returning across the fields to his lonely home.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span>

"A happy family," he muttered, knocking
blooms from the clover with his stick.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="AN_APPLE_TREE">
  <img src="images/image073.png" width="600" height="658"

</div>

<p>"When are you coming home, Hannah?"
asked Chinky. "It's awful lonesome without
you."</p>

<p>"Well I geth it ith," added Stubbins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>"I'm going to stay three weeks more,"
Hannah replied, "and, oh, ma, does table clothing
cost much?"</p>

<p>"There's some that's dear, and some that
ain't,—why?"</p>

<p>"Can't we buy some, ma, and do things the
way other folks do?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulvaney sighed. "When I was a
girl at home," she said, "we had things right,
and after I married your pa I tried to do as
my mother did, but children, it was no use.
Your pa was out of work so much, and his
health wasn't good,"—Mrs. Mulvaney never
referred to the fact that Mr. Mulvaney was a
drunkard,—"and somehow I got discouraged,
and I ain't brought you young ones up
right. Now I feel glad and thankful we've
got enough to eat and wear and a good house
to live in, but it's too late for tablecloths."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because, Hannah, Stubbins wouldn't
know no more how to act up against a tablecloth
than one of his own pigs."</p>

<p>"We could learn," ventured Chinky.</p>

<p>Hannah took courage. "Listen, ma," said
she, "Miss Randall says she never saw such

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>

bright children as we are. She says it's 'mazing
the way we learn, only she hopes that
when Stubbins gets old enough to go to school
he won't keep his pockets loaded full of frogs
and toads, the way he does now. Well, if we
can learn geography and figures and history
things and birds, why can't we learn tablecloths?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulvaney shook her head. "You
have to be born to tablecloths," said she.</p>

<p>"Hannah wasn't born to big, wide, pink
dresses and bows on her hair," announced
Chinky, "but look at her, ma, you'd think
she'd worn 'em all her life. Not as you need
to think you're so smart, Hannah, but I'm
talking about tablecloths and being like other
folks. Guess I use my eyes when I take home
washings, and go after 'em."</p>

<p>"Now, ma, look here. Let's vote about it
with grass. All that wants to be pigs and
never know nothing go and put a long blade
of grass in ma's lap. All what wants to learn
manners, put a little, teenty, weenty piece of
grass in her lap."</p>

<p>The voting began before Mrs. Mulvaney
had time to say a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>"It's for tablecloths and manners," said
Mrs. Mulvaney, pretending that the bits of
grass were too small to be seen. "And if we
use tablecloths the first one that spills anything
may get his head knocked off."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulvaney had seen her neighbour go
home across the fields. Turning to Hannah
she changed the subject. "Since you're all
dressed up," she said, "I suppose you
wouldn't mind going over to Mr. Hodgkins's
on an errand. I bet he'd like a loaf of
gingerbread. I made some yesterday for the
boys. Now remember, Hannah, be nice and
polite, and you, too, Stubbins, for you can
go along seeing's you are all fixed up for
Sunday. That man could turn us out of our
good home if he wanted to, and you young
ones must get on the right side of him. Mind
that."</p>

<span class="small">THE HOME THAT WAS LOST ON CHRISTMAS DAY</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">"What</span> is going to happen?" asked Hannah
pausing at Mr. Hodgkins's front gate and
speaking to Stubbins. "I guess he's going
to have company. The front door's open, and
the window's open, and the side door's open!
What shall we do, Stubbins?"</p>

<p>"Do what ma thed, and give him the cake,
and leth get a look at the company."</p>

<p>"Shall we go to the front door or the back
door?"</p>

<p>"Leth go to the front door, and get a look
at hith houthe, too."</p>

<p>One glance at the long, gloomy hall and
Hannah turned away. "You can stay there
and knock if you want to," she said, "but
it's too lonesome for me. I am going to the
kitchen door."</p>

<p>"Well, thay, wait, tho I am too. There

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>

he ith, Hannah, ther ith Mithter Hodgkinth
thanding by the well."</p>

<p>"What's he looking at?"</p>

<p>The man greeted the children with a smile.
"Good morning," he said, "come here and
see my brother."</p>

<p>"Why, thath a mud turtle," exclaimed
Stubbins, plainly disappointed in the brother.
"Thath a mud turtle 'cauth Mith Randall
thed tho."</p>

<p>"Now, watch," continued Mr. Hodgkins.
"You see, children, this old mud turtle is going
on about his business just as all the creatures
around here are doing, only he moves
a little slowly, to be sure. Now I am going
to give this brown hen over here a touch with
my stick and you'll see what will happen."</p>

<p>"It'll thquawk!" predicted Stubbins, and
he was right. The brown hen made herself
heard all over the yard as she flew away.</p>

<p>"Made the feathers fly, didn't she?"
laughed the man. "Now we'll see what the
mud turtle will do. I won't hit him a bit
harder than I did the hen."</p>

<p>A knock on the mud turtle's back; he
stopped crawling and in went his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>"You'd think he was killed!" Hannah exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Well, he ith a queer one," commented
Stubbins.</p>

<p>"Now you know why I call the mud turtle
my brother," declared Mr. Hodgkins. "Most
people are like hens. When something strikes
them hard they make a big fuss about it, and
after they flutter around a while they go about
their business exactly as they did before. I'm
like the mud turtle. I crawled into my shell,
and now they say I'm a queer one, as Stubbins
says of the turtle."</p>

<p>Hannah turned red. How did Mr. Hodgkins
know that the neighbours called him
queer, and why was he a friendless man?</p>

<p>"Did something strike you hard, Mr.
Hodgkins?" she asked, in tones of sympathy.</p>

<p>"I should like to tell you and your little
brother about it if you care to listen," was
the reply. "You children seem like old
friends. I've stayed so long in my shell I
seem to have forgotten who my friends were,
and I once had plenty of them. I suppose I
have myself to thank, but do you know I

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>

don't suppose there's any one left in the world
who ever gives me a kindly thought."</p>

<p>Hannah suddenly remembered her errand.
"Ain't there, though?" she cried. "Didn't
ma go and bake this gingerbread yesterday
for you, and don't she say you're the best man
that ever breathed?"</p>

<p>"Yeth, thath what," added Stubbins.</p>

<p>Mr. Hodgkins looked pleased. "Did she
do that for me?" he asked, taking the gingerbread
from Hannah, "well, your mother is
a good woman."</p>

<p>"Thath what," assented Stubbins, "and
uth kidth are nithe kidth too."</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,"
chided Hannah, but the three laughed and the
sunlight danced among the leaves. It was a
bright Sunday.</p>

<p>"To-day," began Mr. Hodgkins, "I have
opened my house for the first time in many a
long year. Come with me and see what a big
pleasant home I used to have."</p>

<p>"Ain't you got it now?" demanded Stubbins.</p>

<p>"No," was the response, "I have the house,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span>

my boy, but the home was lost one Christmas
day."</p>

<p>"Lotht your home on Chrithmuth?" questioned
the child.</p>

<p>"Come, I will show you a room that the
sunlight has never shone upon since that same
Christmas."</p>

<p>Silently the children followed Mr. Hodgkins
in the house, through the kitchen, into the
hall.</p>

<p>"This was my home when I was a boy,"
he went on, "and here I brought my wife before
my father and mother died. We'll go
in the parlour first and I'll show you a picture.
You see, I've opened the parlour."</p>

<p>By this time even Stubbins was speechless
with wonder, and clung to Hannah as though
he feared to lose her in the strange man's
house. Everything in the parlour was covered
with dust. In spite of the feeling of awe that
stole over her, Hannah noticed the good furniture
and all that the room contained.</p>

<p>"Here's the picture, children," said Mr.
Hodgkins, opening an album.</p>

<p>Without speaking, Hannah and Stubbins
gazed at the photograph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>"They were mine," said the man, softly,
"my little girl, my little boy, and their
mother."</p>

<p>It seemed to Hannah that if her life had
depended upon it, she could not have said a
word.</p>

<p>"Come," suggested Mr. Hodgkins at last,
as he closed the door and left the parlour,
closely followed by the children. "This was
our sitting-room," he continued, pausing before
a locked door. "This is the first time in
ten years that I have ever turned the key."</p>

<p>Hannah's impulse was to run, but when the
door was opened she felt as if her feet were
growing into the floor. As for Stubbins his
eyes came so near popping out of his head
they really ached for an hour afterward.
What the children saw was a Christmas tree
yellow with age. It was a pitiful sight and
belonged in a darkened room where Santa
Claus might not stumble upon it.</p>

<p>"We'll have some air and light," said Mr.
Hodgkins, raising the shades and opening the
windows.</p>

<p>The tree looked ghastly in the sunshine as
it stood revealed with all its faded, dusty trimmings.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span>

Here and there among the branches
were children's treasures, a small china doll,
a tin horn, a drum and a calico elephant.
Beside the tree were two small rocking-chairs
and on the floor were books.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," whispered Hannah.</p>

<p>"There, child," sympathized Mr. Hodgkins,
"I didn't bring you in here to make you
sad, but this is my secret, and I thought if you
could see this room perhaps we might be better
friends. I thought perhaps you would understand
your queer neighbour."</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" asked the child,
crossing the threshold and standing near the
tree, still clinging to Stubbins.</p>

<p>"This room is just as we left it that Christmas
Day. We drove to a neighbour's in the
afternoon, and while there our little ones went
on the ice to play and were drowned. I came
into the house before their mother, and the
first thing I did was to close this door. The
piano was left open just as you see it now.
We sang a Christmas hymn that morning.
Two months later the children's mother died,
and I was left alone.</p>

<p>"All this our neighbours know, but Hannah

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span>

and Stubbins, no one ever knew we had a
Christmas tree. At first I couldn't take it
down nor touch a thing and so the months
went by, and at last the years, until like the
turtle I have crawled more and more into my
shell."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, dear!" repeated Hannah, no
longer trying to keep back the tears.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Hannah, don't cry, or I shall be
sorry you know my secret. Now we'll shut
the room again and forget it."</p>

<p>"Don't—don't shut the room up again,
Mr. Hodgkins. I wouldn't, if I were you,"
declared Hannah. "Do you know what I'd
do?" she continued, brushing away the tears
and speaking earnestly.</p>

<p>"No, what would you do?"</p>

<p>"I'd take away the tree, and then I'd clean
the room and use it."</p>

<p>"I've often thought of it, Hannah, but
some way I can't do it; and here the old tree
stands just as we left it. It's no use, and yet—see
here, children, tell your mother I'll give
her five dollars if she'll come over to-morrow
when I've gone to town, and—and tend to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span>

this room. You may come with her and go
all over the house if you choose."</p>

<p>"And then," agreed Hannah, "you and
us'll go visiting. Sometimes you come over to
our house to see us in our sitting-room, and
next day or the next we'll all come over here
and visit you in your sitting-room, and we'll
be folks. And Mr. Hodgkins, don't you think
you're the only man that's had to get along
without Christmases, because us kids never
had a Christmas in our lives until last year."</p>

<p>"You mean you never had a Christmas tree
before, don't you, Hannah?"</p>

<p>"No, I mean we never had a Christmas.
We never even knew folks had trees in their
houses until now, but you just wait! This
year we're going to have one of our own."</p>

<p>"Yeth, and I geth you better come and help
uth get it ready," put in Stubbins, "becauthe
you know about the way to fixth 'em."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mr. Hodgkins, "I'll
think about it."</p>

<span class="small">MRS. MULVANEY'S AIR CASTLE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mrs. Mulvaney saw the Christmas
tree she shook her head. "I'm glad you're
with me, Chinky," she began, "I'd hate to be
here alone, and what's more, I hate to touch
that tree. Poor man! To think how he's
missed his folks and him so good. I'd no
more take any money for doing a neighbourly
act like this than I'd fly."</p>

<p>"Well, ma," observed Chinky, "I'd rather
see you with the money than trying to fly with
wings. Only think how you'd look! I bet
your feet'd drag."</p>

<p>"Young man, if you'd use your eyes more
and your tongue less, why then instead of
making fun of your poor old mother you'd be
learning a lesson from this tree before we take
it out."</p>

<p>"What'd I learn?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>"You'd learn how Christmas trees is
trimmed. I think we ought to take pattern by
this so's we'd know how to get up our own."</p>

<p>"Sure enough, ma, I'll run home and get
a pencil and a piece of paper and I'll draw that
tree just as it stands, so we'll know where to
hook up the strings of pop-corn, and the paper
trimmings, and have a tree that is a tree."</p>

<p>Chinky was gone but a short time and soon
finished three remarkable sketches which he
put in his pocket for future use.</p>

<p>"We'll have a Christmas this year that'll
make up for lost time," said Mrs. Mulvaney,
smiling at Chinky through clouds of dust.
"I believe we shall have to take everything
in this room out-doors if we ever expect to
get this place clean. How it all comes back
to me the way my mother used to do things.
We better shut up the piano, though I don't
know so much about this kind as I do about
another."</p>

<p>"You used to call your wash-board a piano,
didn't you, ma?" Chinky remarked.</p>

<p>"So I did, and that ain't saying's I liked
the music of it, either, still, who knows but
our Hannah'll be learning to play this—I

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>

mean, to play a sure enough piano some day.
And Chinky, how'd you like to go to college?"</p>

<p>"Why, Ma Mulvaney!"</p>

<p>"Well, how'd you like it?"</p>

<p>"Not for me, ma, I'm going to raise hens
and turkeys, and I don't want to take on any
more schooling than I have to. What I'm
going to be is a rich farmer. Hannah, she
can go to college," and Chinky grinned.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be a mite surprised," added
Mrs. Mulvaney, "if it all happens."</p>

<p>"What's getting into you, ma?" asked the
boy. "You're talking just like Sally Brown.
I know she thinks that smarty brother of
hers'll be the President of the United States."</p>

<p>"Hoping," agreed Mrs. Mulvaney, wiping
the dust from two little rockers that she decided
would fit Nora and Dora, "hoping is
just as Sally Brown says; it won't do one
mite of harm, and I hope to see my seven
children amounting to something in the world.
My! This is a pleasant room. Just see the
view from the bay-window. That poor man,
to be living here all alone! What are you
laughing at, Chinky?"</p>

<p>"Well, ma, let me tell you. The other night

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>

Stubbins and I were over here helping Mr.
Hodgkins feed the pigs,—you know he has
about twenty-five,—and of course Stubbins
he loves the pigs. Well, Mr. Hodgkins said
'Stubbins, you'd better come over here, and
live with me. I'll give you all the pigs if you
will,' but Stubbins wouldn't do it; he said,
'even with the pigth it would be too lonethome."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Hodgkins," inquired Mrs. Mulvaney,
putting the tin horn in a box, and wondering
if Mike would ever have a chance to
blow it, "what did he say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing much, he laughed and said
something about our being lucky kids, and he
didn't blame Stubbins for wanting to stay with
his ma."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulvaney, with her back to Chinky,
nodded her head and squinted her eyes curiously,
then turned a big rocking-chair around
and sat down for a moment.</p>

<p>"Well, ma, thinking of buying the chair,
are you?"</p>

<p>"Why, Chinky?"</p>

<p>"Because anybody'd think you was in a
store picking out chairs to take home the way

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>

you try 'em all. Which are you going to
keep?"</p>


<div class="figcenter" id="LAUGHING_SOFTLY">
  <img src="images/image090.png" width="600" height="554"
alt="Illustration of Mrs. Mulvaney in the rocking-chair"/>
</div>


<p>"All of 'em, like enough, since you're so
bright," admitted the woman, laughing softly
as she rocked. "And now say, you get to
work and no more fooling. We'll make a bonfire
of that tree. That poor man to be coming
home from town this noon, and no family here

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span>

to meet him and no dinner ready. Come,
Chinky, fly around and we'll get his dinner,
pudding and all before we leave. What if we
was all dead and 'twas your pa?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hodgkins was surprised and pleased
when he reached home. Not for years had
any one taken the least interest in him. With
the coming of the Mulvaneys he began to
realize what he had missed. It was pleasant
to be on friendly terms with one's neighbours.
He was glad the children liked to visit him.
They were good children, too; never made
him any trouble and were always well behaved.
He wondered why Sally Brown had called
them quarrelsome, and why she had said Mrs.
Mulvaney was cross.</p>

<p>Mr. Hodgkins never saw the little shanty
in the city down by the railroad-tracks and the
river, where the seven children were packed
in like sardines. He never knew how hard
was Mrs. Mulvaney's life when she washed
clothes from morning until night, merely to
keep the seven from starving, so of course he
didn't realize that after a few months in the
country, a great change had come over the
family. At last they were folks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>While Mr. Hodgkins ate his dinner that day,
the Mulvaneys gathered for the first time in
their lives around a tablecloth, and if the cloth
happened to be one of the new sheets folded
in half what difference did it make?</p>

<p>"We've got to begin to practise putting on
style without losing no more time," declared
Mrs. Mulvaney, "and, Chinky, you tell Hannah
to ask Sally Brown to come over first
chance she gets, and show you young ones
table manners. You've got to learn 'em. I
may want to ask company in to tea before
long, and we don't want no pigs to the table.
Watch out, there, Stubbins, you've got your
elbow in the butter. If you want something
you can't reach, don't climb up on the table
after it, that ain't manners. Take your fork
and reach over for it this way, do you see?"</p>

<p>"Thay, ma, what if I wath after thyrup!
Th'pothe I could hook into that with a fork?
Oh, ouw, oh, thay, don't thlap me again. Oh,
ouw, thay! I'll be good, I'll be good!"</p>

<span class="small">WELCOME HODGKINS CHOOSES THE CHRISTMAS TREE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> isn't so easy as you might think to choose
a Christmas tree. Many a day early as November
the seven little Mulvaneys trooped
forth in search of one. The woods belonged
to Mr. Hodgkins, who by this time had become
their much loved ideal. Even Cornelia Mary
had changed her mind about the man.</p>

<p>"He doesn't seem half so queer when you
really get acquainted with him," she often remarked
to her mother. Mrs. Brown and
Sally were delighted by the many acts of kindness
he showered upon the Mulvaneys, and
their friends the Turners began to like him.</p>

<p>It so happened that the reason the seven
children were so careful in their choice of a
tree, was because Mr. Hodgkins, the Randalls,
the Turners, Mrs. Brown, Alfred and Sally

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span>

were to share in its joy. The idea of having
a Christmas tree was suggested by Mrs. Mulvaney
to the unbounded satisfaction of the
children.</p>

<p>"Who'll speak the pieces and sing the
songs?" demanded Chinky.</p>

<p>"All of us, of course," Hannah replied.</p>

<p>"Catch me speaking a piece to a tree!"
sniffed Chinky. "Johnnie and Mike and Stubbins,
they can do that."</p>

<p>"Think you're awful smart, don't you?"
began Mike, but his mother cut him short with
her slipper.</p>

<p>Johnnie was the boy who best knew how
easily that slipper came off and should have
known better than to laugh at Mike.</p>

<p>"I'll paddle you next," warned Mrs. Mulvaney.
"You think you're so cunning. Be
quiet, children, and we'll settle about how
things is to be done Christmas Eve. We'll
have the speaking and the singing first, that
being the way it was fixed at the Christmas
tree you all went to at the church last year,
though land's sake that seems ten years ago,
times has changed so much.</p>

<p>"We can sing some hymn tunes together,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span>

company and all, and we'll get Sally and Alfred
to speak the stylish pieces, as you might
say, and maybe they'll do what Nora and Dora
did the last day of school, and speak a Christmas
catalogue together."</p>

<p>"Oh, ma," corrected Hannah, "you mean a
dialogue."</p>

<p>"Take that," continued Mrs. Mulvaney,
boxing Hannah's ears, "and don't be so free
with your book learning as to forget your
manners to your ma. Nora and Dora, they
can speak their old catalogue," this with a severe
look at Hannah, who was rubbing her
ears, "and Stubbins can speak his piece, and
Mike and Johnnie can learn new ones to keep
'em out of mischief."</p>

<p>"Aw," began Mike, but he went no further
as the loose slipper showed signs of dropping
off his mother's foot.</p>

<p>"And you said, as I remember it," went on
Mrs. Mulvaney, "that a church man did some
speechifying in front of the tree. Mr. Hodgkins,
he's the man that can do that, and when
he gets to the end of it we'll all clap our
hands."</p>

<p>"Will Thanta Clauth come netht?" inquired

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span>

Stubbins, resting his chin in both hands
with his elbows upon his knees.</p>

<p>"Aren't you ashamed," replied Mrs. Mulvaney.
"Now don't you s'pose Santa Claus
knows we can take care of ourselves this year?
He better go where they's poor folks. Moses
Aaron, I'm ashamed of you."</p>

<p>"Well, but thay, ma, how about Chrithmuth
prethenth?"</p>

<p>"That's where the real fun of Christmas
comes in," explained Mrs. Mulvaney; "we
make presents for each other. When I was a
girl at home my sisters and I used to begin
making Christmas presents for our mother
and father and aunts and uncles and cousins
and for each other, way back in the summer,
and then we hid 'em till the time came."</p>

<p>At this point Chinky winked at his mother
and nodded his head as much as to say, "You
and I know a thing or two."</p>

<p>"Well, Ezra Jonathan," asked his mother,
"what are you making a fool of yourself
for?"</p>

<p>More winks and shaking of the head this
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>"Well, speak out, Ezra, and don't set there
acting like a dumb idiot."</p>

<p>"You see, ma," stammered the boy, still
trying the effect of winks, "I thought Santa
Claus he wouldn't mind putting the presents
on the tree for us if we left 'em all on the
what-not where he could see 'em easy."</p>

<p>Stubbins caught at the suggestion. "Oh,
thay, ma," he begged, "leth do it, I tell you
uth kidth like that old Thanta Clauth. He
ith all right. I don't think Chrithmuth would
be half tho nithe if he couldn't thee our tree
and put thome prethents on it."</p>

<p>"All right," consented Mrs. Mulvaney returning
Chinky's wink to the best of her ability.
Not being used to winking she had to
screw up one corner of her mouth to do it.
"Now then, after Mr. Hodgkins has his say,
Chinky, I mean Ezra Jonathan, can take the
presents off the tree and give 'em to Hannah
and she can read out the names and Moses
Aaron can carry the presents around and if
he stubs his toes and breaks anything, I'll
warm his jacket right in front of the company.
After that'll come the Christmas dinner."</p>

<p>"Dinner at night?" asked Hannah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, dinner at night," was the reply.
"That's when we're going to have Chink—Ezra's
big turkey. Now ain't you glad you
know manners, and ain't you little boys glad
you picked blackberries enough to pay for our
fine company tablecloth and napkins, and ain't
you glad our cellar's full of vegetables we
raised ourselves? And think of the currant
jelly Hannah made that's awaiting for Christmas."</p>

<p>"We must pick out our tree," Johnnie
broke in, "I think that one I showed you kids
last night was the best in the whole bunch."</p>

<p>"But I don't," objected Hannah, "it's too
tall."</p>

<p>"And the one I got, you say is too short,"
pouted Mike.</p>

<p>"And mine was lop-sided," added Chinky.</p>

<p>"And I can't decide on any of them,"
laughed Hannah.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thay!" cried Stubbins, "I know a
man what'll know a good Chrithmuth tree
when he theeth it."</p>

<p>"That's a fact," approved Mrs. Mulvaney,
"trot right over and ask Mr. Hodgkins for
his advice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>Appealed to by the seven, Mr. Hodgkins
went to the woods with his young neighbours
one bright December day and chose a large,
perfectly shaped spruce.</p>

<p>"It won't do," declared Hannah.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It's too big, Mr. Hodgkins, we'd have to
cut a hole through the ceiling to make it stand
in our sitting-room."</p>

<p>Mr. Hodgkins laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"It's too big," protested the seven.</p>

<p>Mr. Hodgkins laughed again. "I'll go over
and talk to your mother about it," said he.
"We won't cut the spruce down until Christmas
week so it will be fresh and green. If I
can make your mother believe this tree is just
right, we'll most surely have a Merry Christmas."</p>

<p>The seven were disappointed.</p>

<p>"I think he's crazy," sputtered Chinky on
the way home.</p>

<p>"I know he is," grumbled Johnnie, "that
tree's high as our chimney."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Hannah, "ma's got
some sense if he ain't. She won't have that
great big tree, don't you fret."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>"That's right, ma knows what's what,"
added Chinky, kicking the bright snow from
his path and straightening his shoulders.
"She's got a lot of sense."</p>

<span class="small">ON THE TRAIL OF SANTA CLAUS</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mulvaney</span> failed the seven.</p>

<p>"What do you think, anyway?" whispered
Chinky when the children were gathered in
Hannah's room at bed-time. "What ails
ma?"</p>

<p>Hannah shook her head gloomily. "Does
anybody know?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not me," declared Mike. "How'll we
ever get such a whoppering tree in the house?
She won't even go to look at it."</p>

<p>"Nope," added Johnnie, "ma said first
thing that if Mr. Hodgkins thought it was
right, it was right, and since he's been over
here to talk to her about it you dassn't hardly
say tree."</p>

<p>"She—she's getting a new dress made,"
offered Nora.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Dora, "and she says this—this

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>

Christmas party is something we won't
never forget."</p>

<p>"I bet we won't, if we have that tree,"
grumbled Chinky. "We might as well begin
chopping holes through the floor and the roof,
and I don't know but we'll have to cut a little
chunk out of the clouds to make room for our
Christmas tree."</p>

<p>"Oh, thay," put in Stubbins, "make the
hole in the floor big, Chinky, tho we can look
down and thee Thanta Clauth."</p>

<p>"That shows how much little kids know,"
explained Chinky. "You'll have to get out on
the roof, Stubbins, to see Santa Claus, because
I suppose when he catches sight of so much
tree sticking through the roof he'll think it's
the whole thing and he'll hang all the presents
up on top of the house."</p>

<p>This speech was greeted by laughter so loud
Mrs. Mulvaney opened the stair door and
spoke.</p>

<p>"If you young ones don't get in bed inside
of five minutes," said she, "you'll be sorry.
Now I don't want to hear another sound.
How do you suppose I can sew up your Christmas
clothes if you make such an uproar?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>The next day Chinky sharpened his hatchet
on Mr. Randall's grindstone. In the afternoon,
accompanied by his brothers and sisters
he went to the woods to cut down the tree.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="THE_NEXT_DAY">

enough," cautioned Chinky, "so as to give me
enough room to swing my arms."</p>

<p>"Let me chop some," begged Mike.</p>

<p>"Me, too," added Johnnie.</p>

<p>"Look a-here," declared Chinky. "No little
shavers allowed on this job. You ought
to be glad to have a chance to see me do the
chopping."</p>

<p>"Oh, thay," cried Stubbins when the children
reached the edge of the woods. "Who'th
took our tree? Ith gone."</p>

<p>"It's that Randall kid," sputtered Chinky,
scarcely able to believe his eyes. "Look at
the stump, will you, all hacked to pieces—he
said he bet he knew more about cutting down
trees than me. That looks like it! I'll fix
him. Come on, don't stand here like ninnies
looking at the place where our tree stood."</p>

<p>"Leth—leth tell Mithter Hodgkinth,"
sobbed Stubbins.</p>

<p>"All right," assented the angry brother,
"and then I'll give Smarty Randall a taste of
my fist."</p>

<p>"Your tree is gone!" repeated Mr. Hodgkins
when the seven burst upon him. "Well,
there! I know who took it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>"Who?" demanded Mike.</p>

<p>"Santa Claus, sir, the rascal! I thought
that tree he brought in looked extremely familiar!"</p>

<p>"What tree?" asked Stubbins.</p>

<p>"You come in my sitting-room and see,
children."</p>

<p>"It's our tree, sure enough," said Johnnie,
"and did he put it up, too?"</p>

<p>"You better believe he did, and what's
more, you look in this closet."</p>

<p>Mr. Hodgkins opened a door, allowing the
children one brief glimpse of Christmas packages,
dolls, books, sleds, and toys of all kinds.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" cried the seven.</p>

<p>"They are all for you and every one who
comes to the Christmas party," declared the
man. "Santa Claus says this house is the
place for your party because it's bigger than
yours and he brought these presents ahead of
time because he is so busy he was afraid he
might miss us on Christmas Eve."</p>

<p>"Aw," began Chinky, but checked himself
and laughed. "Won't it be jolly," said he,
"that is if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm delighted," insisted Mr. Hodgkins,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>

"only I've asked the minister to come
and"—</p>

<p>"The minister," groaned Chinky, "what
did you go and invite him for?"</p>

<p>"That's all right," interrupted Hannah.
"You ought to have the minister to a Christmas
tree, don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"It was like this, children," said Mr. Hodgkins.
"Your mother said I was to make the
speech, but I persuaded her that the minister
could do it better."</p>

<p>"Bother the minister," whispered Mike.</p>

<p>"I thay tho, too," echoed Stubbins.</p>

<span class="small">THE HOME THAT WAS FOUND ON CHRISTMAS DAY</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Gaily</span> passed the week before Christmas.
Every one was busy, every one was happy.
Mrs. Mulvaney swept and dusted the house of
Welcome Hodgkins from top to bottom. Not
a corner escaped her broom.</p>

<p>In the sitting-room the Christmas tree glittered
and shone. Frost sparkled on the windows,
while outside in the winter sunshine
sang the chickadees.</p>

<p>Early Christmas Eve the company arrived,
smiling and joyous. Mrs. Mulvaney greeted
them in her new gown. The seven stood in
a row to welcome Sally and Alfred. The little
girls' dresses and the boys' waists were made
from the same piece of bright pink chambray,
whereat Tom Randall grinned and punched
Cornelia Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>Everything passed off as Mrs. Mulvaney
planned. Stubbins spoke his piece beautifully,
the singing was good, and the dialogues were
perfect. Mr. and Mrs. Isaac Turner, Mr. and
Mrs. Randall, and Sally's mother, having no
other part on the program, clapped their hands
vigorously at the close of each performance.</p>

<p>Finally, at a signal from Mrs. Mulvaney,
the minister rose. "Friends," said he, "my
presence here to-night shall no longer be a
mystery to you. If Mrs. Mulvaney and Mr.
Hodgkins will please step forward, we will
give these seven fatherless children a Christmas
present."</p>

<p>Stubbins bent forward with his mouth open,
and listened in amazement while the minister
married his mother to Welcome Hodgkins.
He was the first to speak at the close of the
ceremony.</p>

<p>"Well, thay! that wath a thurprithe, but
ith a good one."</p>

<p>Every one seemed to agree with Stubbins,
and for awhile the Christmas tree was entirely
forgotten. Poor Chinky was so astonished
and dazed, he could scarcely cut the gifts from
the tree when reminded of his duty. At last

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 111]</span>

his mother brought him to his senses by a more
or less gentle shake.</p>

<p>"Well, ma," laughed Chinky, "it's you,
ain't it? I almost didn't know you for a
minute."</p>

<p>"Don't you be sassy," chided his mother,
"or you'll get something besides Christmas
presents right here in front of your second pa
and the company."</p>

<p>Chinky didn't look a bit alarmed, and in the
midst of fun and excitement did his part in
the distribution of the gifts.</p>

<p>At the dinner-table Stubbins snuggled close
beside his new father. "Well," said he, and
all the children agreed with him, "I thay this
ith thertainly a Merry Chrithmuth!"<br /><br /></p>
